## Running Redis and Kibana with docker-compose

By using the docker-compose.yml file, you can easily run a complete testing environment. The network settings are `net: "host"`, which means that the redis server will be listening on your localhost, default port ().

## Usage
- Start by typing `docker-compose up`.
- After a while, Redis is listening on localhost, port 6379.
- Every message sent to Redis with key `my_redis_key` will be processed by Logstash.

## Change configuration
If you want to change the key, simply edit the `logstash.conf` file, there is an entry `key`. By default, Logstash is setup to process V0 messages, if you want to change this to V1, edit the entry `codec` from `oldlogstashjson` to `json`.
